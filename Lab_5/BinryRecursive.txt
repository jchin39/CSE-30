The general idea of this is to half the array each time the function calls upon itself.
To do this, the function needs the initial index, the last, the key, and of course the array.
The array is halved every time the key is compared with the middle value of the array.
Pass in values to function
Create the middle by subtracting the initial index from the size, dividing that by two, then adding the initial index back in.
Then, compare the value at the middle index to the key. If it is the same, the right index is found.
if it is smaller, the size becomes the middle index -1(1 before the key)
If the middle value is larger, the initial index becomes the middle +1 (1 after the key)
this repeats until the value is found. If it is not, -1 is returned.
