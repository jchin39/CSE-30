The idea is the same as binary recursive, except for it is done in a loop.
The passed arguments are the same.
The difference is the loop.
Iterate throughout the loop (initial array index to size - 1)
Same calculation for the middle as recursive.
With this, we are directly moving the index of the array with the same checks as recursive.
If the middle is the same as the key, value is found
If the middle is smaller, set the size to 1 less than the middle.
if the middle is larger, set the initial to 1 more than the middle.
The next time the loop goes through, the same check which was passed in the first iteration will be repeatedly passed until the value is found.
